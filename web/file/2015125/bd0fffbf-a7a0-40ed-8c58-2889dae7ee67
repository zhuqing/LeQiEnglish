32:<p style="TEXT-INDENT: 2em"><span style="color:#FF0000;">【环球时报综合报道】针对近日有缅甸军方官员称，</span>有“中国雇佣军”参加果敢战斗的说法，果敢同盟军领导人彭家声24日在电话中对《环球时报》记者说，不接受中国籍人员参战是果敢同盟军“铁的底线”。此前针对“果敢少数民族地方武装与中国有联系”的传闻，中国<span class="infoMblog"><a class="a-tips-Article-QQ" href="http://t.qq.com/wj_xlt#pref=qqcom.keyword" rel="wj_xlt" target="_blank">外交部</a></span>发言人华春莹曾回应说，中方一向尊重缅甸的主权和领土完整，不允许任何组织和个人利用中国领土从事破坏中缅关系和边境地区稳定的活动。缅甸军方24日称在“扫荡清剿战斗”中取得“重大进展”，但对大批难民来说，果敢的局势远未稳定。缅甸政府军与果敢同盟军之间的战斗进入复杂的拉锯战状态。</p><p style="TEXT-INDENT: 2em">21日，在首都内比都举行的新闻发布会上，缅甸首席军事安全会主席、国防部参谋处(<span class="infoMblog"><a class="a-tips-Article-QQ" href="http://t.qq.com/lujunhnzz#pref=qqcom.keyword" rel="lujunhnzz" target="_blank">陆军</a></span>)特别战役指挥官妙吞吴中将说，根据战俘供述，有一些中国籍雇佣兵已经加入彭家声的部队。据了解，虽然不少缅甸媒体都关注了此次新闻发布会，但军报《妙瓦底日报》、“缅甸之光”和《缅甸新光报》等官方媒体的报道中并没有上述内容。此前，缅甸总统办公室主任吴昂敏在联邦议会答辩时曾表示，中国中央政府与发生在果敢地区的战事无关。</p><p style="TEXT-INDENT: 2em">果敢同盟军领导人彭家声24日在接受《环球时报》记者电话采访时说：“从2009年‘8・8’事件时起，果敢方面就严禁中国籍公民进入果敢参加果敢同盟军，我们也不会接受中国籍人员参加武装行动，这对我们有害无利。最为重要的是，中国执法机构一旦发现我们这边有中国籍公民参战，会给我们巨大压力。因此，不允许中国公民参战是我们的原则。”果敢同盟军一名杨姓旅长也告诉《环球时报》记者：“不要说接受中国退伍兵，发现有中国公民非法过界，我们也是采取劝返政策。”</p><p style="TEXT-INDENT: 2em">中国相关部门24日对《环球时报》记者说，中国法律严禁中国公民到境外参加武装组织和战争行动，一旦发现会面临严重后果，“缅甸军方发言人所说的中国籍人员被逮捕的事，缅甸媒体此前就有报道，当时官方的说法是他们参加了一些境外玉石走私活动”。</p><p style="TEXT-INDENT: 2em">根据24日缅甸军方公布的最新战报，2月21至22日，缅甸国防军与果敢同盟军发生5场激烈战斗，攻克老街至拱掌之间18英里长的交通枢纽。此役缅军伤亡20余人，发现果敢同盟军尸体3具、枪支7支以及一批弹药。至此，缅军宣布已全面控制老街-拱掌公路。然而，果敢居民杨先生24日告诉《环球时报》记者：“白天，缅甸国防军控制着果敢公路和城镇。晚上，彭家声的部队就出来袭击，打了就跑。”缅甸“伊洛瓦底”网站报道说，老街仍面临游击战。</p><p style="TEXT-INDENT: 2em">23日晚偷回到果敢老街市东城区家里看情况的李老三对记者说：“这几天局面相对稳定，缅军的行动有所约束。他们刚到果敢战场时草木皆兵，见到可疑的人或物就开枪。”但气氛依然紧张。李老三溜回老街时全城停电，他刚打开手电筒，就有子弹飕地从耳朵边飞过，吓出一身冷汗。</p><p style="TEXT-INDENT: 2em">中国临沧官方发布的消息显示，进入中国躲避战祸的果敢难民有3万多人。其中，一部分得到中国当地政府或民间机构救助，另一些人在中国边境地区租房，还有人跑到中国亲戚家避难。缅甸国有媒体《缅甸新光报》24日报道称，12日至21日晚间，缅甸第二大城市曼德勒的交通主管部门和热心人士共安排269辆车，将5732名滞留该地区的老街居民送回家乡。</p>一名邻近战乱地区的克钦独立军官员对《环球时报》记者说，缅甸政府军在靠近中国边界地区埋设了大量的地雷，给难民救助工作带来危险。缅甸军方则指责，果敢民地武袭击了运送难民的车队。缅甸Eleven 23日报道称，红十字会的救援车队21日傍晚在运送老街居民前往滚弄难民营途中，遭遇第三次袭击，造成包括一名缅甸广播电视台记者在内的4人受伤。17日，两名缅甸红十字会志愿者在护送100多名老街难民时也遇袭受伤。果敢民地武须对袭击事件负责。果敢民地武发言人22日反驳称，官方媒体报道失实，该武装未曾在事发地带部署军队。Eleven 24日报道称，缅甸联邦和平工作委员会与各民族地方武装一致同意，将于3月中旬恢复全国停火协议的谈判。该谈判去年9月陷入停滞。但“缅甸女性和发展提议组织”近日对862名来自钦族、克钦族、掸族等3个民族地区居民进行的一项调查显示，各方很难达成停火协议，即便达成也难以落实。该报道说，主要的阻碍因素包括地区发展和教育、高成本的复杂司法体系等。高水准的公共事务合作才是达成并最终实现停火、维护民族地区人民安全的关键。33:asdasdasdasdasdasd34:<p><em>Editor's note: A few years ago, the normal way to get a taxi was to hail one on the street.

Losar dates to about 100 BC, the time of the ninth king of Tibet, Pude Gungyal. The celebration runs as long as 15 days. </p><p>Although the heavy snow that fell in Lhasa two days ago has not melted yet, residents are gearing up for the festival. Many of the hot shopping spots, such as the Ramoche Road and the Barkhor Shopping Mall, are packed with customers. </p><p>&quot;My business is much better than last year. With the New Year festivals together, I had more shoppers,&quot; said Basang Lhamo, a stall owner in the Barkhor market. </p><p>&quot;I did not have time to prepare for my own Losar,&quot; said the 38-year-old, adding that she will close her business on Tuesday, one day before New Year's Eve. </p><p>As hordes of shoppers prepared for the festival, some bus drivers find it difficult to avoid traffic jams. &quot;Ahead of Losar, with buses and streets crowded with people, it is hard to keep the bus moving smoothly,&quot; said Nyima Tsering, a driver in Lhasa. </p><p>Karma Sonam, 43, a restaurant owner in the city, said his business has boomed this month. &quot;My restaurant has been so full that my wife and our staff don't have time for lunch most of the time,&quot; he said. His family will travel to Xigaze for the festival, and he will give the staff a 15-day holiday. </p><p>Sonam Droma is a Tibetan woman who married a Han. They plan to spend the festival on the grassland. &quot;It is more fun to embrace Losar in a remote grassland, as we enjoy the evening bonfire dancing and singing,&quot; Sonam Droma, 27, said. &quot;It is happier on the grassland.&quot; </p><p>Features of the festival include activities such as eating guthuk - a kind of noodles - expelling evil, pilgrimages to temples, parties, circle dancing and singing. &quot;Traditionally, guthuk contains nine ingredients, such as yak meat, cheese, a wild sweet potato called toma, cabbage, wheat, barley, beans, water and salt,&quot; said Choezin Lhamo, a 13-year-old Tibetan girl in Lhasa. &quot;Each of the nine elements you find in your guthuk has a symbolic meaning.&quot; </p><p>On the morning of the first day of the festival, Tibetan residents in Lhasa will cook changku - cheese, brown sugar and roasted barley flour boiled in barley wine - an activity followed by good-luck offerings to each other made from chemar, a mixture of roast barley flour and butter. </p><p>Many residents of Lhasa make a pilgrimage to Buddhist temples in Jokhang and Ramoche, as well as to the Potala Palace. </p><p><em>palden_nyima@chinadaily.com.cn</em> </p>39:<p>The son of China's second-richest man is at the center of a media storm after telling reporters on Valentine's Day that his top criteria for choosing a girlfriend was that she had to be &quot;<span>buxom</span>&quot;.</p><p><span>Wang Sicong, the outspoken only son of real estate tycoon Wang Jianlin, made the comment at a charity event at a branch of his family's movie theatre chain in Beijing.</span></p><p>Xinhua News Agency criticized him, saying he was spreading &quot;undesirable obsessions with money, sex and violence&quot;.</p><p>The 26-year-old, who is a board member of his father's Wanda Group and chairman of Prometheus Capital, a private equity investment firm, helped raise more than 500,000 yuan ($79,950) for the China Next Generation Education Foundation by auctioning the opportunity to watch a film with him on Valentine's Day.
